# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Platform Security Guide

This document outlines the security architecture, best practices, and deployment considerations for the SOC Platform.

## üîê Security Architecture

### Network Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Backend and frontend networks are isolated
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: All services use TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites
- **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting protects against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx acts as a security gateway with security headers

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for different user roles
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for privileged accounts
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforced complexity and rotation requirements
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with timeouts

### Container Security
- **Non-Root Users**: All containers run as unprivileged users
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Security Options**: No-new-privileges and read-only filesystems where possible
- **Minimal Base Images**: Alpine and slim images reduce attack surface

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted with AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of passwords and API keys
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security events

## üöÄ Quick Security Setup

### 1. Initial Security Configuration
```bash
# Generate secure secrets and certificates
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# Start the platform with security hardening
./scripts/init.sh
```

### 2. Post-Deployment Security Steps
```bash
# Apply additional hardening
./configs/security-hardening.sh

# Verify security configuration
docker-compose ps
docker logs nginx
```

## üîë Default Accounts & Passwords

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Change all default passwords immediately after deployment!**

| Service | Username | Default Password | Role |
|---------|----------|------------------|------|
| Admin | `admin` | `changeme123` | Super Admin |
| Analyst L1 | `analyst1` | `analyst123` | SOC Analyst Level 1 |
| Analyst L2 | `analyst2` | `analyst2sec` | SOC Analyst Level 2 |
| Security Engineer | `security_engineer` | `seceng456` | Security Engineer |
| Threat Hunter | `threat_hunter` | `hunter789` | Threat Hunter |

## üèóÔ∏è Security Configuration Files

### Core Configuration Files
- `.env` - Environment variables and passwords
- `configs/users.conf` - User accounts and RBAC settings
- `configs/api-keys.conf` - API key management
- `configs/alert-rules.yml` - Security detection rules
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container security settings

### SSL/TLS Certificates
```
configs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ca.crt                    # Certificate Authority
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elasticsearch-certs/     # Elasticsearch TLS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kibana-certs/            # Kibana TLS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wazuh-certs/             # Wazuh TLS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logstash-certs/          # Logstash TLS
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx-certs/             # Nginx TLS
```

## üîç Security Monitoring & Alerting

### Built-in Security Rules
- **Authentication**: Brute force detection, privilege escalation
- **Network**: Port scanning, suspicious traffic, DNS tunneling
- **Malware**: File hash detection, process monitoring
- **Data Protection**: PII detection, data exfiltration
- **System**: Resource exhaustion, file integrity monitoring

### Alert Channels
- Email notifications
- Slack integration  
- Webhook endpoints
- SIEM integration

## üèÜ Security Best Practices

### 1. Password Management
```bash
# Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters)
# Enable MFA for all privileged accounts
# Rotate passwords every 90 days
# Never use default passwords in production
```

### 2. Network Security
```bash
# Use firewall rules to restrict access
# Enable VPN for remote access
# Implement network monitoring
# Regular security scanning
```

### 3. Container Security
```bash
# Regularly update base images
# Scan images for vulnerabilities
# Use minimal privilege containers
# Monitor container runtime security
```

### 4. Data Security
```bash
# Encrypt sensitive data at rest
# Secure backup procedures
# Data retention policies
# Regular security audits
```

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Workflow
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts trigger incident response
2. **Analysis**: SOC analysts investigate and categorize threats  
3. **Containment**: Automated playbooks contain threats
4. **Remediation**: Security engineers implement fixes
5. **Recovery**: Systems restored to normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvement

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Emergency shutdown
docker-compose down

# Isolate compromised containers
docker network disconnect soc-backend <container_name>

# Emergency backup
./scripts/emergency-backup.sh

# Forensic data collection
docker logs <container_name> > forensic-logs.txt
```
